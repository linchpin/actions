# v4 of .deployment/pressable-entrypoint.sh. Runs ON THE PRESSABLE SERVER.
# Previously this script was wget'd from the v3 branch by the server at deploy
# time; in v4 it is uploaded alongside the release zip by the deploy-pressable
# composite action, so the pinned action ref is the code that runs.
#
# Steps:
# 1. Unzip the uploaded release
# 2. Detect platform-managed symlinks and configured protected paths
# 3. Sync plugins, themes and mu-plugins into the public directory
# 4. Keep only the newest release zips, remove old release folders
# 5. Flush the page cache when available

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Symlink + protected-path handling
#
# KEEP IN SYNC with the identical block in the sibling host entrypoints
# (deploy-wpengine, deploy-cloudways). Every action ships a self-contained
# entrypoint by design — the ref you pin is the code that runs — so this block
# is duplicated rather than sourced from a shared file.
#
# Managed hosts serve some plugins from platform-owned storage and link them
# into the site: on Pressable, jetpack and woocommerce are usually symlinks in
# wp-content/plugins rather than real folders. rsyncing a release copy onto such
# a path is destructive either way — rsync follows the link and writes THROUGH
# it (so --delete prunes files the platform owns), or the link is replaced by a
# real directory and the site silently stops receiving platform updates.
#
# Rule: whatever is a symlink on the server is left exactly as it is. Projects
# can protect additional paths that are still real folders through the deploy
# action's protected-paths input (vars.PROTECTED_PATHS), which arrives as
# protected-paths.txt next to this script.
